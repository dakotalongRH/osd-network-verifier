## Sample Variables 
## Fill in the values below and rename me to "terraform.tfvars" 

# Your AWS Profile
# This profile should be configured in your AWS credentials file, typically located at ~/.aws/credentials on Unix-based systems and C:\Users\USERNAME\.aws\credentials on Windows. 
# The profile configuration should look something like this:
# 
# [default]
# aws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
# aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY
#
profile = "default"

# The AWS region where you want to create your resources
region = "us-east-1"

# The availability zone within the region where you want to create your subnets
availability_zone = "us-east-1a"

# The CIDR block for your VPC
vpc_cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"

# The CIDR block for your public subnet within your VPC
public_subnet_cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/24"

# The CIDR block for your proxied subnet within your VPC
proxied_subnet_cidr_block = "10.0.1.0/24"

# (optional) A list of CIDR blocks for which you'd like to create "proxy escape routes", 
# i.e., routes that cause clients in your proxied subnet to connect to certain websites 
# directly without going through the proxy. If you're interested in allowing direct connection
# to a list of numbered domain names, for example, try using the following bash one-liner to 
# generate a list of CIDRs that cover all of the domain names
# echo -n \[; for IP in $(dig +short $(seq -f"inputs%g.osdsecuritylogs.splunkcloud.com" -s" " 1 15) | sort -u); do echo -n "\"$IP/32\", "; done; echo -e "\b\b]"
proxied_subnet_escape_routes = []

# A prefix to add to the Name tag associated with most of the resources created by these scripts
name_prefix = "transparent-proxy"

# SSH public key to use for ec2-user@proxy-machine
proxy_machine_ssh_pubkey = "ssh-rsa AAAAB3N...SrbX8ZbabVohBK41 replaceme@example.com"

# A CIDR block containing your workstation's IP, for SSH/webUI access to the proxy machine for debugging. 
# Running "echo $(curl -s ipv4.icanhazip.com)/32' should produce a sane default value
developer_cidr_block = "123.123.123.123/32"
